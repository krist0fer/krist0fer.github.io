# Portfolio
## Natural Language Processing
### [Text analysis on scientific paper](https://github.com/krist0fer/krist0fer.github.io/blob/master/portfolio/nlp_test.ipynb)
Sample implementation of Natural Language Processing on a research paper to explore elements of tokenization, word embeddings and vectorization.
## Network Theory
### [Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/krist0fer/krist0fer.github.io/blob/master/portfolio/SNA_test.ipynb)
Simple implementation of SNA to randomly generated data. Exploring concepts like clustering, centrality and community detection.  
## ETL, descriptive statistics and machine learning
### [Explore, transform, load and prediction with PySpark and H2O](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/4901559484398239/3985008231453347/377123234447052/latest.html)
This notebook showcases the ETL process and model prediction for an example dataset. Rather than showcasing skills in feature engineering, model building or interpretation, this notebook is meant to show familiarity with 1) the PySpark framework and display my understanding of the ETL process, and 2) the functionalities available with the H2O API.
### [Exploratory analysis, visualization and prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/kristofersoderstrom/pubg-main)
This notebook showcases data exploration, feature engineering, visualization and predictions with a video-game database. 
### [Multilayer Perceptron with Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/kristofersoderstrom/titanic-mlp)
 A simple implementation of a fully connected network on the educational Titanic dataset. One of my first home projects.
## Econometric analysis and statistical inference
### [A spatial analysis of innovation in regional Europe](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/7615461 )
Implemented a spatial autoregressive model to successfully explain the agglomeration of innovative regions in Europe.
### [The gravity of tacit knowledge flows in the presence of ICTs](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/8900542)
Adapted the model of gravitational force to trade to explain the importance of geographical distance in the flow of knowledge, regardless of the recent advances in information communication technologies.
## Writing
### [From prediction to decision making](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-your-predictions-might-be-falling-short-opinion-9b1fada35137)
Article in Towards Data Science on the common misunderstanding of correlation and causation.
